/**
 * @file i2c_utils.hpp
 * @brief Utility helpers for working with I2C devices.
 *
 * This header currently provides a flexible bus scanning helper. It is kept header-only and
 * marked inline for zero linkage overhead when used in multiple translation units.

/**
 * @brief Scan an I2C bus for device addresses.
 *
 * This function probes each address in the specified range and reports devices that ACK.
 * It is designed for efficiency and flexibility on ESP32 / Arduino platforms, allowing
 * customization of address range, inter-probe delay, error reporting, and target wire bus.
 *
 * Typical valid 7-bit I2C address range is 0x08 - 0x77 (below 0x08 are mostly reserved).
 *
 * @param printer        Optional Print target for human-readable output (defaults to Serial if available).
 * @param wire           Reference to the TwoWire bus to scan (defaults to global Wire).
 * @param startAddress   First address to test (inclusive). Defaults to 0x08 to skip reserved addresses.
 * @param endAddress     Last address to test (inclusive). Defaults to 0x77 (maximum 7-bit address).
 * @param delayMicros    Microseconds delay between probes. Kept short (default 20Âµs) to minimize total scan time.
 * @param showErrors     If true, prints addresses that return error code 4 (other error codes are silently ignored).
 * @param foundCallback  Optional callback invoked for each found address (receives the 7-bit address).
 *
 * @return int           Number of devices that acknowledged in the range.
 *
 * @note You should call wire.begin() before invoking this scan.
 * @note A yield() is performed periodically to keep the watchdog serviced on ESP platforms.
